        </h3>
        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-4">
          <li>
            <strong>Initial Consultation:</strong> We begin with a thorough
            consultation to understand your vision, preferences, and
            requirements. This initial step helps us align our design and
            construction strategies with your expectations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Conceptual Design:</strong> Our team develops a conceptual
            design that captures the essence of your vision. We focus on
            creating a layout that maximizes space, functionality, and aesthetic
            appeal.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Detailed Planning:</strong> Once the conceptual design is
            approved, we move on to detailed planning. This phase includes
            architectural blueprints, material selection, and a comprehensive
            project timeline.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Construction Execution:</strong> With the design finalized,
            our skilled construction team takes over. We ensure that every
            aspect of the build is executed to the highest standards, with
            attention to detail and quality craftsmanship.

            touches that bring your home to life. Our team conducts a thorough
